# spellbee.html — reviewing segmented problem entries

How to review a **segmented** problem entry (a word entry whose `<…>` region is split into
`=`-separated segments, e.g. `"20|@🐘|<e=l=e=ph=a/E=n=t>|ph/f"`). Review is **not** scoped to a
particular level/class: **every** entry whose text contains a `=` is in scope, at any level.
Segmented entries currently all live at **level 20**, so one found at any other level is reported
as a finding (this expectation may change in future). For the format itself see
[`spellbee-content.md`](spellbee-content.md);
for the phoneme ids see the `phoneme_sounds` object and for class tags
[`spellbee-classes.md`](spellbee-classes.md).

## Per-entry checklist

For each entry `"level|image|text|class"`:

1. **Image** (2nd field). If empty (`"20||…"`) **and the target word is picturable**, add one that
   hints at the word — `@<emoji>`, `word@<emoji>`, or a `~file.svg` / named ref (same forms as any
   word entry). The picture must denote the **specific** target — for a homophone, specifically
   enough to distinguish it (a *sea* scene for `sea`, not `see`).
   **Only picture what is picturable.** A word with no clear, unambiguous depiction — abstract and
   function words (*were, this, just, because, very, of*) — is **left imageless**: a vague or
   miscuing picture is worse than none. An empty image on such a word is a valid **final** state,
   not an omission — so confirm the word is genuinely not picturable, then leave the field empty
   and mark the line reviewed. The audit does **not** flag a missing image (it can't tell "not done
   yet" from "deliberately none"), so an empty image never shows as needing work — judging
   picturability is this review step's job, not the audit's.
2. **Class tag** (4th field). If empty, add the appropriate `spelling/phoneme` tag(s) for the
   target word's notable grapheme(s) (see [`spellbee-classes.md`](spellbee-classes.md)). Only
   add when the field is empty — don't churn existing tags.
3. **Phonemes.** Every segment's resolved phoneme must be the correct **Received Pronunciation
   (SSBE)** sound. A segment resolves via its explicit `/phoneme` spec, else via
   `segment_default_phoneme` (`default_phoneme()`), else to `''` (unmapped). Go through **every**
   segment and, wherever the resolved phoneme is missing (`''`) **or wrong for RP**, add/replace
   an explicit `/phoneme` with the correct id from `phoneme_sounds` (e.g. `/ɒ/`→`o`, `/ɔː/`→`O:`,
   `/ɑː/`→`a:`, `/ə/`→`E` (`Er` for an `-er` ending), `/ʌ/`→`A`, `/eɪ/`→`eI`, silent→`x`). **Always override a wrong
   default** — the defaults are broad and frequently wrong in context (see below); never leave a
   segment voicing the wrong sound just because a default supplied one.
   - **Split-digraph link `/X`.** A silent split-digraph "e" that lengthens the vowel **two boxes
     to its left** (one consonant box between them, e.g. `<h=o/EU=m=e/X>`) may be spec'd `/X`
     (capital) instead of `/x`: it is silent exactly like `/x` but also draws a linking line back
     to the vowel box in the UI. Use `/X` only when the vowel is genuinely tensed by the e (`eI`,
     `i:`, `aI`, `EU`, `ju:`, `u:`); leave r-controlled or reduced vowels (horse, come, chocolate)
     as plain `/x`. It folds to `x`, so the audit still sees a valid phoneme — **do not "correct"
     `/X` back to `/x`.**
4. **Mark it.** Append an end-of-line comment `// reviewed` so the line is not re-reviewed.

## Tooling that surfaces gaps

Two `console.error`s fire during page load (open the browser console):

- **`Unknown phoneme "" for segment …`** — from `get_processed_word()`; flags a segment whose
  phoneme is missing from `phoneme_sounds` (i.e. resolves to `''`). These are exactly the
  segments step 3 fills.
- **`Unknown class tag …`** — from `init_wordlist_impl()`; flags a class tag absent from
  `known_class_tags` (a typo). That set is the registry of every valid tag.

To enumerate gaps in bulk, run the saved extractor [`segmented-audit.js`](segmented-audit.js):

```
node agent/segmented-audit.js [html-file] [expected-level]   # defaults: spellbee.html, expected-level 20
```

It loads the app's own `word_repository` / `process_word_data()` / `get_processed_word()` /
`phoneme_sounds` / `known_class_tags` and lists, for **every** segmented entry (any whose
text contains a `=`, at any level), every segment resolved to its phoneme (`*` = explicit spec,
`~` = a `/X` split-digraph link, `[?]` = missing, `[!x]` = resolved to an unknown phoneme id),
flagging a missing class / phoneme, an **invalid phoneme**, a **`/X` link with no target
box two segments to its left** (`link-no-target`), a **class tag absent from
`known_class_tags`**, or an entry whose **level is not the expected-level**
(`UNEXPECTED-LEVEL`, default 20) — so the audit always matches runtime behaviour. It reports
structural gaps only; judging whether a *valid* resolved phoneme is *correct for RP* — or whether
a `/X` link is warranted (the vowel is genuinely tensed by the silent e) — is the (LLM/human)
review step, and **arguable specs are put to the maintainer** (see Judgement notes). A **missing
image is not a gap** and is not flagged: for a non-picturable word (step 1) an empty image is the
correct final state, so judging picturability is the review step's job, not the audit's.

Once the edits are decided, apply them with [`apply-line-edits.js`](apply-line-edits.js):

```
node agent/apply-line-edits.js spellbee.html edits.json [--dry-run]
```

`edits.json` is an array of `{"old": "<full entry line>", "new": "<edited line>"}` (edits may
also be piped on STDIN with `-`). It is **transactional**: each `old` must occur exactly once
or it writes nothing and lists the offenders, so use the whole line as `old` — including its
trailing `,` and `// reviewed` comment — to keep it unique. Then re-run `segmented-audit.js`
to confirm 0 gaps remain.

**Round-trip:** `segmented-audit.js` (find gaps) → decide RP phonemes/images/classes → append
`// reviewed` and emit `old`→`new` line pairs → `apply-line-edits.js` (commit) → re-audit.

## Judgement notes

- **Reduced / elided vowels.** Unstressed vowels are usually `/ə/` = `E` (e.g. the `a` of
  *elephant*, *distance*), but an unstressed **`-er` ending** is its own phoneme **`Er`**
  (*teacher, water, rapper*) — and `er`→`Er` is a default, so an `er` segment resolves to `Er`
  without a spec. A vowel that is dropped in RP is silent = `x` (e.g. the middle `o` of
  *chocolate* /ˈtʃɒklət/).
- **Same grapheme, context-dependent sound.** `o` is `o` /ɒ/ in *box*, but `A` /ʌ/ in *monkey*,
  *something*; `a` is `ae` /æ/ in *hanging*, `O:` /ɔː/ in *water*, `E` /ə/ in *distance*. Judge
  by the word, not the letter — the class tag on the entry is for grouping and may differ.
- **Syllabic `l` endings.** A syllabic `-al`/`-el`/`-le`/`-ol` /əl/ (as in *capital*, *portal*,
  *table*, *symbol*, *crystal*) is voiced with the dedicated **`sl`** phoneme ("syllabic l") —
  e.g. `<c=a=p=i=t=al/sl>`, `<t=a=b=le/sl>`. This is the maintainer's standing choice — do not use
  `l`, `E`, or `O:` for these (`O:` is only for true `all` /ɔːl/ words like *call*/*tall*/*wall*).
  Watch for the transposition typo `ls` (invalid — the audit flags it `[!ls]`).
- **Other no-single-phoneme matches.** For any *other* ending with no clean ascii phoneme,
  approximate with the nearest id and flag for a maintainer decision.
- **`-ed` endings** are `Id` /ɪd/ only after t/d (*wanted*); otherwise `/t/`=`t` after a
  voiceless sound (*walked*) or `/d/`=`d` after a voiced one (*mentioned*).
- **Plural / 3rd-person `-s` on a `/t/`-final base stays two segments** — `t` + `s`, never a
  merged `/ts/` (e.g. *boots* `<b=oo/u:=t=s/s>`, *cats* `<c=a=t=s/s>`). English has no `/ts/`
  phoneme: the [ts] here is `/t/`+`/s/` across a morpheme boundary, so splitting it keeps the base
  word intact and the regular plural pattern visible (`s`→`s` after a voiceless sound, `s`→`z`
  after a voiced one — see *windows* above). Merge into a `ts` affricate **only** when the [ts] is
  *tautomorphemic* (inside one morpheme, e.g. *pizza*, *tsar*), and only if a `ts` id exists — it
  currently does not, so a word like *pizza* is the sole motivation for ever adding one.
- **Common wrong defaults to watch.** `e`→`/e/` is wrong for the many reduced `e`s that are
  `/ɪ/` (*market, kitchen, elephant*'s 2nd `e`, *express*'s 1st `e`) or `/ə/` (*wooden, garden,
  different*); `u`→`/ʊ/` is wrong for the usual `/ʌ/` (*lunch*); `oo`→`/uː/` is wrong for the
  `/ʊ/` of *foot/book*; `y`→`/ɪ/` is wrong when `y` is the consonant `/j/` (*young*); `s`→`/s/`
  is wrong for a voiced plural `/z/` (*windows*); `n`→`/n/` is `/ŋ/` before k/g (*monkey*).
- **Fix wrong explicit specs too.** A clearly-wrong explicit spec is corrected, not just flagged
  (e.g. *walked*'s `-ed` is `/t/` after /k/, not `/d/`).
- **Ask the maintainer about arguable specs.** Where a segment's RP phoneme is genuinely
  uncertain — a weak vowel that could be `/ɪ/`=`I` or `/ə/`=`E`, or a variant pronunciation
  (e.g. *during* `u` = `ju:` vs a `UE`-type value, *real* `ea` = `i:` vs `IE`) — **do not decide
  silently**: ask the maintainer and apply their choice. This is a standing preference.
